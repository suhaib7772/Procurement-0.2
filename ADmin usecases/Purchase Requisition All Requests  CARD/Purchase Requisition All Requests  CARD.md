**Use Case: Purchase Requisition/All Requests** 

**Actor:** Admin

**Use Case Description:** This use case outlines the process of managing purchase requisitions by an admin within the procurement system. The admin can view, filter, and manage purchase requisitions based on their status and priority.

**Trigger Point:** The trigger point occurs when the admin needs to review, approve, reject, or place a purchase requisition on hold within the procurement system.

**Pre-conditions:**

1\. The admin has access to the procurement system with appropriate permissions.

2\. There are existing purchase requisitions submitted by requestors.

**Post-conditions:**

1\. The admin has reviewed and taken necessary actions on the purchase requisitions.

2\. Purchase requisitions are appropriately categorized based on their status and priority.

**Normal Flow:**

1\. The admin logs into the procurement system using their credentials.

2\. Upon successful login, the system presents the admin with the dashboard containing five cards representing different categories of purchase requisitions:

- All Requests: Displays all purchase requisitions regardless of status.
- Approved Requests: Displays purchase requisitions that have been approved.
- Reject Requests: Displays purchase requisitions that have been rejected.
- Pending Requests: Displays purchase requisitions that are pending approval.
- On Hold Requests: Displays purchase requisitions that are currently on hold.

3\. The admin can select any of the cards to view the respective list of purchase requisitions.

4\. The system provides a search bar and filter button to facilitate the admin in sorting and filtering the purchase requisitions based on criteria such as status (Approved, Rejected, On Hold, Pending) and priority (High, Medium, Low).

5\. After applying the desired filters, the system presents a panel containing detailed information about each purchase requisition, including:

- Requestor Name: Name of the employee who initiated the requisition.
- Location: Location where the requested items are needed.
- Creation Date: Date when the requisition was created.
- Total Cost: Total cost of the requested items.
- Priority: Priority level assigned to the requisition (High, Medium, Low).
- Status: Current status of the requisition (Pending, Approved, On Hold, Rejected).

6\. The admin can review the details of each requisition and take appropriate actions such as approving, rejecting, or placing requisitions on hold based on their status and priority.

**Alternative Flow:**

1\. If the admin encounters any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the purchase requisitions, they may request additional information from the requestor or other relevant parties before making a decision.

2\. In case of technical issues or system errors, the admin may need to refresh the page or contact technical support for assistance.

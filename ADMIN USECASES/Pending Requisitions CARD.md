**Normal Flow:**

2\. The system displays a top module with five cards, including the "Pending Requests" card.

3\. The admin selects the "Pending Requests" card to view all pending purchase requisitions.

4\. The system presents a list of pending purchase requisitions with details including:

- Request number
- Name
- Location
- Date
- Total cost
- Priority
- Status (marked as "Pending")

5\. The admin utilizes the filter button and search bar to narrow down the list based on specific criteria such as username and date.

6\. The admin scrolls through the list if necessary to locate specific pending purchase requisitions.

7\. The admin reviews the details of the pending purchase requisitions to gain insight into the pending requests and their status.

- Requesting additional information or clarification from requesters.
- Rejecting the pending requisitions if considered necessary.

- If there are specific actions associated with individual pending purchase requisitions, such as contacting requesters for updates, the admin may select the corresponding requisition and initiate the action accordingly.

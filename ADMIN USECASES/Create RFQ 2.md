**Actor:** Admin

**Description:**

3\. Supplier information is stored in the system.

**Post-condition:**

2\. Suppliers are invited to submit quotations for the requested items or services.

**Normal Flow:**

1\. The admin navigates to the requisition section of the procurement system.

2\. The admin selects a specific requisition containing the request for which an RFQ needs to be created.

4\. The system presents a form for the admin to input RFQ details:

- Open date
- Close date
- Required delivery date
- Location

3\. In case of system errors or technical issues, the admin may need to contact technical support for assistance in resolving the issue.

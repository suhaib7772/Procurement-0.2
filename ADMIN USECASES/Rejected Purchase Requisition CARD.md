**Use Case: Rejected Purchase Requisition Panel**

**Actor:** Admin

**Use Case Description:** The admin views the panel displaying rejected purchase requisitions within the procurement system.

**Trigger Point:** The admin accesses the rejected purchase requisition panel from the main dashboard.

**Pre-conditions:**

- The admin has appropriate permissions and access rights to view rejected purchase requisitions.
- There are rejected purchase requisitions available in the system.

**Post-conditions:**

- The admin gains insight into rejected purchase requisitions and may take further actions if necessary.

**Normal Flow:**

1\. The admin accesses the procurement system and navigates to the main dashboard.

2\. The system displays a top module with five cards, including the "Reject Requests" card.

3\. The admin selects the "Reject Requests" card to view all rejected purchase requisitions.

4\. The system presents a list of rejected purchase requisitions with details including:

- Request number
- Name
- Location
- Date
- Total cost
- Priority
- Status (marked as "Rejected")

5\. The admin utilizes the filter button and search bar to narrow down the list based on specific criteria such as username and date.

6\. The admin scrolls through the list if necessary to locate specific rejected purchase requisitions.

7\. The admin reviews the details of the rejected purchase requisitions to gain insight into the reasons for rejection and other relevant information.

8\. Based on the information gathered, the admin may decide to take further actions such as:

- Initiating a new purchase requisition based on the rejected request.
- Communicating with relevant stakeholders to address issues leading to rejection.
- Investigating further into the rejection reasons for process improvement.

**Alternative Flow:**

- If there are no rejected purchase requisitions available in the system during step 3, the admin may not find any entries in the rejected purchase requisition panel.
- If the admin encounters errors or issues with filtering or searching for rejected purchase requisitions during step 5, the admin may retry or report the issue for resolution.
- If there are specific actions associated with individual rejected purchase requisitions, such as reopening the requisition for review, the admin may select the corresponding requisition and initiate the action accordingly.

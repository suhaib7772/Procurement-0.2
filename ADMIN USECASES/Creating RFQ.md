**Use Case: Creating RFQ from Requisition**

**Actor:** Admin

**Description:**

This use case outlines the process of creating a Request for Quotation (RFQ) based on a particular requisition within a procurement system. The RFQ is generated using details from the requisition, including the RFQ number, location, creation date, total cost, and priority.

**Trigger Point:**

The trigger point occurs when a requisition for goods or services is approved and requires procurement through the creation of an RFQ.

**Pre-conditions:**

1\. The Admin is logged into the procurement system.

2\. A requisition for goods or services has been approved and is available for procurement.

3\. The required supplier information is available within the system.

**Post-conditions:**

1\. An RFQ is created based on the requisition details.

2\. The RFQ is sent to selected suppliers for quotations.

3\. Suppliers provide quotations for the requested goods or services.

**Normal Flow:**

1\. The Admin navigates to the requisition management section of the procurement system.

2\. The system displays a list of approved requisitions.

3\. The Admin selects a particular requisition for which an RFQ needs to be created.

4\. The system presents the details of the selected requisition, including:

- RFQ number
- Location
- Creation date
- Total cost
- Priority

5\. The Admin initiates the RFQ creation process.

6\. The system prompts the admin to select suppliers for the RFQ.

7\. The Admin selects suppliers from the available list or adds new suppliers if necessary.

8\. After selecting suppliers, the admin reviews the RFQ details and makes any necessary modifications.

9\. The Admin submits the RFQ.

10\. The system generates the RFQ based on the requisition details and sends notifications to the selected suppliers with the RFQ details and the deadline for submitting quotations.

**Alternative Flow:**

1\. If the required supplier information is not available within the system, the admin may need to first add or update supplier details before proceeding with RFQ creation.

2\. If there are multiple approved requisitions, the admin can create RFQs for each requisition individually or consolidate them into a single RFQ depending on procurement requirements.

3\. In some cases, the admin may need to negotiate terms or obtain additional information from the requesting department before finalizing the RFQ creation process.

4\. If the requisition details are incomplete or unclear, the admin may need to collaborate with the requesting department to clarify requirements before proceeding with RFQ creation.
